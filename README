== About ==

"PHP Video for Everybody!" is a PHP script that generates HTML to include video
in a web page. It is based on the code "Video for Everybody!" hosted at

http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody

It was designed to streamline the process of incorporating video in a standards-
compliant way.


== Running the Code ==

The constants at the beginning of the script should be defined before use:

Constant						Type			Description
VH_CONTROLS						boolean			Whether or not to use the browser's default controls
VH_PRELOAD						boolean			Whether or not to preload the video
VH_AUTOPLAY						boolean			Whether or not to automatically begin playing the video on page load

If Flash player fallback is desired, the following constants must be defined:

VH_FLASH_PLAYER_LOCATION		string			The full path to the flash player
VH_FLASH_PLAYER_FILETYPES		array(string)	The filetypes supported by the flash player

Simply include the script in any file you wish to use the function.
